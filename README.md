Oh my god, just finished The Wedding Banquet and lemme tell ya, what a ride. Like, imagine inviting your parents over for a totally fake marriage just to keep 'em happy, and it ends up being a complete circus with emotions flying every freakin' where. It’s honestly exhausting trying to keep a fake marriage going eesh. Good thing I’m just dealing with paper-pushing and not that kinda chaos at work.

Anyway, the main dude, Wai-Tung, seriously, do you think he ever imagined his mom would get so into planning the wedding of the century? I mean, parents—a whole different species when it comes to marriage stuff. It’s SO relatable, you just nod along while they go on their wild planning spree. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you haven’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it yet, honestly, it’s worth it just to see the mom go full-on wedding planner.

And that scene where Simon’s like just trying to juggle all the lies while maintaining his sanity, man, it’s like an everyday HR department meeting. You're trying to keep everyone happy and pretending everything's under control while sipping your tenth coffee of the day. You know what I mean? It’s like you just wanna scream, can I please just have a chill day for once?

> Also, I can’t get over the fake marriage becoming this big beautiful messy real thing. Sooo typical, you start pretending for convenience and boom! Emotions explode everywhere. It’s like when you say you'll just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 one 𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘥𝘦 on 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹, and suddenly it’s 3 AM and you're questioning all your life choices.

That ending though, it’s got all the feels. Plus, there’s something kinda satisfying about how it all comes together like that. Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 chaos transform into a happy accident. Pretty sure that never happens when trying to organize a surprise office birt𝘏𝘋ay. Maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first before diving into wedding planning, you'll thank me later.

I should be sleeping but hey, procrastination buddies, right? Anyway, if anyone’s planning a wedding, I'm basically a pro now after this  , minus the absolutely fake marriage bit. 🤣 Okay, babble over, g’night!
